# Go-Reloaded Product Overview

## Purpose
Go-Reloaded is a high-performance text processing tool that transforms text files using various commands. It's designed for efficient text manipulation with minimal memory usage, making it suitable for processing files of any size.

## Key Features

### Text Transformations
- **Numeric Base Conversion**: Convert hexadecimal and binary numbers to decimal format
- **Case Transformations**: Change text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize words
- **Article Correction**: Automatically fix "a/an" usage based on vowel sounds
- **Punctuation Spacing**: Fix spacing around punctuation marks
- **Command Chaining**: Apply multiple transformations to the same word sequentially

### Performance Characteristics
