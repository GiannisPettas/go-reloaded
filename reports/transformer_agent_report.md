## Implementation Details

### Completed Tasks (6-8)
- **Token System**: Defined TokenType enum (Word, Command, Punctuation, Quote)
- **Tokenization**: Regex-based parsing that identifies all token types
- **Hex Conversion**: Supports positive/negative hex, case-insensitive, validates input
- **Binary Conversion**: Supports positive/negative binary, validates 0/1 only

### Test Results (Tasks 6-8)
```
=== RUN   TestTokenizeTextBasic
--- PASS: TestTokenizeTextBasic (0.00s)
[... all 20 tests passing ...]
PASS
```

## Code Coverage
- **86.9% coverage** - Excellent coverage for implemented functionality
- All edge cases tested (negative numbers, invalid input, empty strings, multi-word ranges, punctuation grouping, quote pairs, article rules, command chaining, invalid commands, cross-chunk context)
- Comprehensive validation of tokenization, conversions, case transformations, punctuation spacing, quote repositioning, article correction, command chaining, error handling, and cross-chunk processing

## Functions Available
1. **TokenizeText()** - Parses text into structured tokens
2. **ConvertHex()** - Converts hex numbers with (hex) commands
3. **ConvertBinary()** - Converts binary numbers with (bin) commands
4. **ApplyCaseTransform()** - Handles (up), (low), (cap) with word counts
5. **parseCaseCommand()** - Parses case commands with optional word counts
6. **FixPunctuationSpacing()** - Attaches punctuation to preceding words
7. **RepositionQuotes()** - Moves quotes to correct positions around words
8. **CorrectArticles()** - Changes "a" to "an" before vowels and "h"
9. **ApplyAllTransformations()** - Orchestrates all transformations with proper chaining
10. **ApplyAllTransformationsWithContext()** - Handles cross-chunk word references

## Key Features Implemented
- **Negative Number Support**: Both hex and binary handle negative values
- **Input Validation**: Invalid hex/binary numbers are ignored gracefully  
- **Case Insensitive Hex**: Supports both uppercase and lowercase hex digits
- **Command Recognition**: Proper parsing of (hex), (bin), (up), (low), (cap) commands
- **Multi-Word Transformations**: Supports (up, n), (low, n), (cap, n) syntax
- **Boundary Handling**: Gracefully handles requests for more words than available
- **Punctuation Grouping**: Consecutive punctuation marks are grouped together
- **Smart Attachment**: Punctuation attaches to preceding words when available
- **Quote Pair Matching**: Finds and repositions matching quote pairs
- **Quote Attachment**: Attaches quotes to first and last words in quoted content
- **Vowel Detection**: Recognizes all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and 'h' for article correction
- **Case Preservation**: Maintains original case when changing "a" to "an" or "A" to "An"
- **Command Chaining**: Supports multiple commands on same word (e.g., "1010 (bin) (hex)")
- **Left-to-Right Execution**: Commands execute in proper order for chaining
- **Error Tolerance**: Invalid and malformed commands are ignored gracefully
- **Transformation Pipeline**: Orchestrated execution of all transformations

## Issues Encountered
- None for completed tasks - all tests passing

## Dependencies Ready
- [x] Tokenization system ready for all remaining transformation tasks
- [x] Number conversion foundation established
- [x] Token manipulation patterns proven

## Status: COMPLETE âœ…

## Final Implementation Summary
- **Complete FSM**: All transformation rules implemented
- **Cross-Chunk Support**: Commands can reference words from previous chunks
- **Error Tolerance**: Graceful handling of invalid commands
- **Command Chaining**: Left-to-right execution with proper pipeline
- **86.9% Code Coverage**: Excellent test coverage across all functionality

## Ready For Integration
Transformer Agent is ready for Controller Agent integration with full functionality.
