# Test Agent Report

## Task 2: Basic File Operations Test Framework
- [x] Test utilities implemented
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Code coverage: 69.2%
- [x] Issues encountered: Minor unused import fixed
- [x] Next agent dependencies ready: Yes

## Implementation Details
- Created `internal/testutils/testutils.go` with core test utilities
- Implemented `CreateTestFile(content string) (string, error)` for temporary test file creation
- Implemented `CleanupTestFile(path string) error` for test file cleanup
- Implemented `CompareFiles(expected, actual string) error` for file comparison
- Added comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

## Test Results
```
=== RUN   TestCreateTestFile
--- PASS: TestCreateTestFile (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCleanupTestFile
--- PASS: TestCleanupTestFile (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCompareFiles
--- PASS: TestCompareFiles (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCompareFilesNonExistent
--- PASS: TestCompareFilesNonExistent (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCreateTestFileEmpty
--- PASS: TestCreateTestFileEmpty (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCreateTestFileWithUnicode
--- PASS: TestCreateTestFileWithUnicode (0.00s)
PASS
```

## Test Coverage Analysis
- **69.2% coverage** - Good coverage for utility functions
- All critical paths tested including error conditions
- Unicode support validated
- Empty file handling tested
- File comparison logic verified

## Utilities Available for Other Agents
1. **CreateTestFile()** - Creates temporary files with specified content
2. **CleanupTestFile()** - Removes test files safely
3. **CompareFiles()** - Compares file contents for validation

## Dependencies Ready
- [x] Test framework ready for all subsequent agents
- [x] File operations utilities available
- [x] Unicode handling validated
- [x] Error handling patterns established

## Next Steps
All other agents can now use these test utilities for their TDD implementation.
