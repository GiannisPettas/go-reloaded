# Config Agent Report

## Task 1: Project Setup and Configuration
- [x] CHUNK_BYTES constant defined: 4096
- [x] OVERLAP_WORDS constant defined: 20
- [x] Configuration validation implemented
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Issues encountered: None

## Implementation Details
- Created `internal/config/config.go` with system constants
- CHUNK_BYTES set to 4096 bytes (4KB) for optimal memory usage
- OVERLAP_WORDS set to 20 words for sufficient context preservation
- Implemented Config struct with Validate() method
- Added comprehensive test coverage with edge cases

## Test Results
```
=== RUN   TestChunkBytesConstant
--- PASS: TestChunkBytesConstant (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestOverlapWordsConstant
--- PASS: TestOverlapWordsConstant (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestConfigValidation
--- PASS: TestConfigValidation (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestConfigValidationInvalid
--- PASS: TestConfigValidationInvalid (0.00s)
PASS
```

## Dependencies Ready
- [x] Constants available for all other agents
- [x] Go module initialized (go-reloaded)
- [x] Project structure established

## Next Steps
All other agents can now proceed with their tasks using the defined constants.
