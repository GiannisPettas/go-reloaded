## Reporting Schedule

1. **After each task completion**: Agent updates their report file
2. **Before starting dependent tasks**: Verify previous agent reports show completion
3. **Daily standup**: All agents review report status
4. **Final delivery**: Integration Agent provides comprehensive system report
