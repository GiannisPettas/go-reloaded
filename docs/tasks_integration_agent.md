# Integration Agent Tasks â€” Go Reloaded

Tasks for the Integration Agent focused on end-to-end testing and validation.

---

## Task 19: Integration - Golden Test Suite
**Functionality**: Execute all golden tests (T1-T22)  
**TDD Steps**:
1. **Red**: Write integration test runner for all golden tests
   - Create test cases for each golden test (T1-T22)
   - Set up input files with golden test content
   - Define expected output for each test
2. **Green**: Implement test execution and result comparison
   - Create `tests/integration_test.go`
   - Implement `RunGoldenTest(testID string) error`
   - Execute complete workflow for each test
   - Compare actual vs expected output
3. **Refactor**: Optimize test execution and reporting
4. **Validate**: All 22 golden tests pass

**Dependencies**: All previous agents and tasks

## Task 20: Integration - Performance Validation
**Functionality**: Ensure memory efficiency with large files  
**TDD Steps**:
1. **Red**: Write performance tests with large input files
   - Create large test files (1MB, 10MB, 100MB)
   - Test memory usage during processing
   - Test processing time benchmarks
2. **Green**: Implement memory usage monitoring
   - Add memory profiling to integration tests
   - Measure peak memory usage
   - Validate memory stays within limits (should be constant regardless of file size)
3. **Refactor**: Optimize performance bottlenecks if found
4. **Validate**: Memory stays within acceptable limits

**Dependencies**: Task 19

---

## Task 22: Final Integration
**Functionality**: Complete system validation  
**TDD Steps**:
1. **Red**: Write comprehensive integration tests
   - Test complete system with various file types
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Test Unicode handling across the system
   - Test concurrent usage scenarios
2. **Green**: Execute full test suite and fix any remaining issues
   - Run all unit tests, integration tests, and golden tests
   - Fix any failing tests or integration issues
   - Validate system meets all requirements
3. **Refactor**: Final code cleanup and optimization
4. **Validate**: All requirements are met and system is production-ready

**Expected Output**:
- Complete test suite with 100% pass rate
- Performance validation report
- System ready for production use
- Documentation of any limitations or known issues

**Dependencies**: Tasks 19, 20, and all previous agent work
