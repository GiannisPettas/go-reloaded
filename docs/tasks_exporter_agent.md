# Exporter Agent Tasks â€” Go Reloaded

Tasks for the Exporter Agent focused on output file writing.

---

## Task 5: Exporter - Basic File Writing
**Functionality**: Write processed text to output file  
**TDD Steps**:
1. **Red**: Write tests for writing text chunks to output file
   - Test writing single chunk to new file
   - Test appending multiple chunks to existing file
   - Test writing empty content
   - Test file permission and directory creation errors
2. **Green**: Implement basic file writer with append capability
   - Create `internal/exporter/exporter.go`
   - Implement `WriteChunk(filepath, content string) error`
   - Implement `AppendChunk(filepath, content string) error`
   - Handle file creation and directory creation
3. **Refactor**: Improve error handling and file management
4. **Validate**: Output file contains expected content

**Expected Output**:
- `internal/exporter/exporter.go` with file writing functions
- Progressive writing capability for memory efficiency
- Comprehensive error handling for file operations

**Dependencies**: Config Agent (Task 1)
**Next Tasks**: Used by Controller Agent for workflow integration
